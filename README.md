# Simon Sound Game

This is a sound-based memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
I created it to explore DOM manipulation, sounds, timers, and user interaction in web development.

## How to Play

- Press any key or click to start the game.
- Watch the pattern of colored buttons and repeat it.
- Each level adds one more color to the sequence.
- Choose your mode and challenge yourself.

## Game Modes

You can choose the mode from the dropdown at the top:

- Normal Mode – Standard gameplay. Repeat the pattern step-by-step.
- Memory Mode – The full sequence is played again on every level. You must recall and input the entire pattern.
- Time Trial – A 3-second timer runs at every step. Miss it or get it wrong and it's game over.

## Now Responsive

- Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Buttons stay square and organized
- Fonts scale based on screen size
- Dropdown and layout adjust for better usability

## Files Included

- `index.html` – Main structure
- `styles.css` – Fully responsive styling
- `game.js` – Game logic
- `sounds/` – Sound files for each color and wrong move

## What I Learned

- How to use jQuery for DOM events and animations
- Managing game state, levels, and timers
- Handling sound playback
- Making layouts responsive using CSS Grid and media queries

## To Do (Maybe Later)

- Add score tracking or leaderboards
- Improve mobile UX even more
- Let users upload their own sound themes

## Try it Out

Just open `index.html` in any browser. No installation needed.
